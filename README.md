# MKDS Tool-Assissted Battles script
A script with informations about items, CPUs and your kart. Useful for TASing Balloon Battles

# Usage
- Download the repo
- Use [MKDasher's DeSmuME](https://github.com/mkdasher/desmume-widescreen)
- Go in Tools, Lua Scripting, New Lua Script Window... then Browse... and open MKDS_TAB.lua

# TODO

- Show CPUs' next items when their items are in the item roulette state (instead of the ? box)
- Fix "Can speed" and "Can use" that sometimes turns true 1 frame too early
